Stirring writing [&#x201c;After Rio, we know. Governments have given up on the planet&#x201d;][monbiot] by George Monbiot in reaction to the collapse of the Rio Summit. He still finds reasons to continue to make efforts towards preserving the biosphere. Its clear however that we cannot look to governments and international agreements to do anything significant.

> Was it too much to have asked of the world&#x2019;s governments, which performed such miracles in developing stealth bombers .. global markets and trillion-dollar bailouts, that they might spend a tenth of the energy and resources they devoted to these projects on defending our living planet? It seems, sadly, that it was.

Monbiot pledges to focus on &#x201c;rewilding&#x201d; which I am also keen to work on.  
Another thinker in this area is Paul Kingsnorth who discusses in this [article][guardian] why he started the [Dark Mountain][dark-mountain] project. Dark Mountain is in the last throws of raising money for its third anthology of writing, illustration and prose. I bought the first book and have ordered the third, its good reading and thought provoking. Check it out [here][dark-mountain 2]
