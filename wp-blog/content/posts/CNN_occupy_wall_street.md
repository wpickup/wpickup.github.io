I had missed the interesting social experiments Ruskofff describes, the local media is adopting its usual superficial view.
  
[CNN: Occupy Wall Street is not a Protest but a Prototype][google]  

> &#x201c;Occupy&#x201d; is anything but a protest movement. That&#x2019;s why it has been so hard for news agencies to express or even discern the &#x201c;demands&#x201d; of the growing legions of Occupy participants around the nation, and even the world. Just like pretty much everyone else on the planet, occupiers may want many things to happen and other things to stop, but the occupation is not about making demands. They don&#x2019;t want anything from you, and there is nothing you can do to make them stop. That&#x2019;s what makes Occupy so very scary and so very promising. It is not a protest, but a prototype for a new way of living.&#xa0;(Via [Douglas Rushkoff][rushkoff].)
