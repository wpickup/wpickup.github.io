Seth Godin has published a [free ebook][typepad], ["Things that matter"][typepad]. It contains over 70 short essays from todays leading thinkers. Definitely worth a read. I found resonances in many of the entries however the following extract from Howard Mann caught my attention as its a phenonmena I see growing daily.  

> We walk the streets with our heads down staring into 3-inch screens while the world whisks by doing the same. And yet we&#x2019;re convinced we are more connected to each other than ever before. Multi-tasking has become a badge of honor. I want to know why.
