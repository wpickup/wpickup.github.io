Just bought [a bundle][abookapart] from [A Book Apart][abookapart 2], excellent value - especially as eBooks.  

I already had the [CSS3 book by Dan Cederholm][abookapart 3] and its a good little book. Its the little part that I particularly like, these days I find I do not have the time to work through large technical books and much prefer condensed focused works like the ones published by A Book Apart. Another thing they have right is providing multiple formats so I can read this on my Kindle and the Macbook Air, the [prags][amazon] led the way on this and another favourite publisher.
