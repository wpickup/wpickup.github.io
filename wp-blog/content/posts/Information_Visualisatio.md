Very interesting diagrams to see at the [Web Science Industry Forum Poster Session][scribd] via [Mark Bernstein][markbernstein]

Mark Bernstein, the author of the [Tinderbox][eastgate] platform is also a scientist who studies hypertext.

His recent post contains a link to numerous web science posters developed at various universities.

Lots of graphic design inspiration to be found [here][scribd].
