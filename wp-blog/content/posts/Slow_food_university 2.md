When Slowlane joined [Slow Food][slowfood] recently they sent a booklet outlining their various initiatives, The Slow Food Companion. Two ventures that sounded particularly interesting were the [University of Gastronic Sciences][unisg] (UNISG) and the [Terre Madre](http://www.terramadre.info/ "Terre Madre"). The university is based in Piedmont and claims to be the first academic institution in the world dedicated to the study of gastronomy. Subjects include Botany, Food Technology, History of Agriculture, Sensory Analysis and Anthropology. The curriculum combines humanities and sciences with food technology and culture. An [article][smh] appeared today in the [Sydney Morning Herald][smh 2] about a local man who is studying at the UNISG, he is living a simple life in the local village, going to the market three times a week and practising what they are learning by cooking for fellow students in the evening. Also mentioned in the [article][smh] was the [Terra Madre][terramadre], an annual Slow Food gathering in Turin that bring together thousands of artisanal food producers, farmers, fisherman from 150 countries, cooks, academics from over 200 universities, representatives of NGOS, journalists and of course slow foodies of other descriptions. This years [Terra Madre][terramadre] promises to be huge, I hope to attend one of these in the next few years. Sounds amazing.
