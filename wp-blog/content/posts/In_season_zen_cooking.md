[Ethical Eating][sustainableinsight] book [reviewed][lighterfootprint] in the Eco Pages of the [Sydney Morning Herald][smh]

We rented a great DVD - [How to Cook Your Life][apple] should be very interesting to anyone who still has a yellowing copy of the [Tassajara][sfzc] cookbook or bread book as it features Ed Brown who also wrote those books back in the 70's. Ed has been practising Zen and cooking for over 30 years and the video is full of insights.
