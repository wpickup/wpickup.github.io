Album by [Chris Smither][smither]

I first heard Chris at the [Blue Mountains Music Festival][bmff] a few years ago, and I'm excited to see he is coming back again this year. We loved his music and went back to see his show again the next day. This [new album][smither 2] is excellent.

I have nearly all of Van's albums and this continues his return to form after a bit of a slump a few albums ago. Full of lyrics inspired by the Global Financial Crisis and Van's usual&#xa0;theme's. There is a stronger Jazz flavour than he's add for a while&#xa0;and the album features some great sax and plenty of horns.
