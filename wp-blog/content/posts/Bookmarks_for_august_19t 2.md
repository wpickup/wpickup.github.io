These are my links for August 19th through August 28th:

  - [Neil Gaiman: Make good art][zenpencils] - These cartoons are a great way of learning more about influential creatives and how they view the world.

  - [Bill Watterson A cartoonist's advice][zenpencils 2] - Lovely comic and story exploring the challenge of doing you're own work.

  - [The terrible and wonderful reasons why I run long distances - The Oatmeal][theoatmeal] - If you love running you should enjoy this cartoon. Rang very true for me (Thanks Shane)

  - [Deep Work and the Good Life][calnewport] - Some more photos of writers workspaces in this interesting post
