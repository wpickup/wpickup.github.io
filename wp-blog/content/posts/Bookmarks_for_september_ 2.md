These are my links for September 18th through October 9th:

  - [Rewild the Child][monbiot] - Reading this I realise how lucky I was to grow up where children roamed about freely and at a time when there was still plenty of nature to be found not far from the back door.

  - [The Internet Is a Surveillance State][schneier] - "Maintaining privacy on the Internet is nearly impossible. If you forget even once to enable your protections, or click on the wrong link, or type the wrong thing, you've permanently attached your name to whatever anonymous service you're using."

  - [Top 10 Excuses Why We're Still Addicted to Supermarkets][permaculturenews] - I am against much of the damage wrought by supermarkets, yet I am guilty of many of these excuses from time to time. Good reminder to stay vigilant.
