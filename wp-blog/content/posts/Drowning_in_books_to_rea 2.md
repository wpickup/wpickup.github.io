I love books, i enjoy being given them at this time of&#xa0;the year and I enjoy&#xa0;buying them at any time. Unfortunately I sometimes fall behind with reading them.
  
The **to read pile** has grown to the point where I decided&#xa0;I needed to create a list to keep track of them - [Omnifocus][omnigroup] to the rescue. Listing them like this should discourage me from acquiring any more until I have reduced this backlog.

The [Tufte][edwardtufte] and [Alexander][natureoforder] [books][amazon] were acquired as sets and are works I have been keen to have in my library for years. Christopher Alexanders' [A Pattern Language][amazon 2] is one of my favourite books. I'll take my time with these and expect to revisit them often.  
  
[Dark Mountain][dark-mountain] and [eaarth][amazon 3] share themes of coming to terms with a changed world and looking to the future.  
  
[The Adventures of Jack De Crow][amazon 4] will appeal to anyone who has sailed dinghy's especially Mirror's. We built on of these in our garage during the 70's.  
  
And a smattering of IT books the most interesting of which is hopefully&#xa0;the [Design of Design][amazon 5] by Fred Brooks of [Mythical Man Month][amazon 6] fame. Still a relevant book although [not everyone thinks so][jacopretorius].  
  
Now all I need to do is polish up my speed reading skills&#x2026;and then there are the numerous magazines...
