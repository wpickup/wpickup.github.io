While browsing the website of designer [Zach Debord][zachdebord] (found via a Make RSS post) I came across this&#xa0;great picture of a chook in the snow with a jumper on, she looks very cosy. Head over to their site to see more of these pictures in a&#xa0;slideshow.  
Their [blog][fadetofuture] has quite a few posts about their chickens and burgeoning interest in Permaculture.  
Worth a look.
  
For the those with a technical bent Zach's [beam][wikipedia] robots are stunning works that merge art and electronics.

They remind me this work by [Robert Klippel][sculpture] which featured 87 small painted objects.
