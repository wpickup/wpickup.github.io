These are my links for October 13th through December 8th:

  - [Frank Chimero &#xd7; Library][frankchimero] - Frank has relegated this website design and is moving on, I really like the minimalism. This page is a simple and clean way to present and interesting selection of books. Check out Franks own book recently re-issued at http://bit.ly/1d3OtEz

  - [The Most Effective Way Of Visualizing Funnels][linkedin]
  - [Why Microsoft Word must Die][antipope] - I hadn't thought about Wordstar for ages, great article about the history of Word and its many failings
