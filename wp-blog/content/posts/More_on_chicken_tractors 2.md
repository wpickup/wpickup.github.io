Since my [post][slowlane] about chickens which mentioned the Linda Woodrow inspired chook dome. I have noticed that people are searching in google for information about chicken tractors. This post provides a few more links to information on this subject.  
[The Chicken Tractor gallery][thecitychicken] has over 140 pictures with many different types shown. As the construction skills required are very basic, a good picture will often be enough for you to build your own using materials to hand.  

#### DIY

#### Commercial Chicken Tractors
before Permaculture they were generally just known as moveable coops or arks)

  - Alanna Moore has written widely about keeping chickens, one popular title is Backyard Poultry - Naturally, available at [Green Harvest Books][greenharvest]. She also writes a very popular column in [Earth Garden magazine][earthgarden].
