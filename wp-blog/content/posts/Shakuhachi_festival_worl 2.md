Just returned from a concert that was the major public event of the 5th&#xa0;[World Shakuhachi Festival][worldshakuhachifestival08]. This gathering was a rare opportunity to see and hear some of the worlds foremost players and was an extraordinary experience. &#xa0;Tonights concert featured pieces played on Shakuhachi, Koto, Shamisen and harp. A musical and accomplished Australian Aboriginal welcome ceremony was performed by Matthew Doyle. A mass playing of Temuke by the festival participants was a highlight. 

All the performances were excellent, Riley Lee was superb however it was the Ajikan (meditation on the letter A) played by Living National Treasure Reibo Aoki that was the most absorbing. He had a powerful presence that brought a deep stillness to the auditorium.
