After some months of not posting due in part to the limitations of Octopress, I have changed buses again. The site is now being built with Rapidweaver and uses the Rapidblog plugin to synch with a blogger account. This allow posting from the Blogger web interface and from IOS blogging apps like [Blogsy][apple].
