I have been interested in [Permaculture][wikipedia] since 1980 when I stumbled upon a copy of Permaculture 2 in our local bookshop (the same shop also introduced me to [The One Straw Revolution][onestrawrevolution] and [Ecotopia][wikipedia 2]&#xa0;around the same time).

Over the years I have experimented with various permaculture methods and been fortunate enough to meet [Bill Mollison][wikipedia 3] on a number of occasions. One of these was at the Tanelorn Music Festival held at Stroud in the Hunter Valley in 1981, not long after I had discovered the book. I clearly remember Bill wearing a skin of some sort as he ambled about the festival. I also remember the inspiring spirit of his Permaculture workshop which had a strong focus on Ethics.

Maddy Harland, the editor of the Permaculture Journal has written a succinct introduction to the subject of Permaculture ethics which you can read [here][permaculture]. You can download a free copy of the magazine from the same page.

The [Permaculture Research Institute][permaculturenews] has a dynamic web site with a large range of resources online.
