The May/June issue of [Resurgence][resurgence] has arrived and it looks very interesting.

Its a special focus issue titled "The money delusion: In search of true wealth". It kicks off with an excellent editorial from Satish Kumar which introduces the topic.  

Here are a few quotes to give you a flavour of the article:

> "Let us be clear. Money is not wealth. It is a delusion to think that money is wealth. True wealth is good land, healthy animals, flourishing forests, clean water, honest work, abundant creativity and human imagination"

and

> "For example, there is never a shortage of money for wars and weapons, but it is always in short supply for arts and education"

Its worth a read and can be found [here][resurgence 2]
