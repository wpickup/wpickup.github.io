Since I subscribed to the Harvard Business Review blog posts I have seen a steady stream of sharply observed and well thought out pieces. Many are aimed at corporate efficiency however a good smattering challenge the existing order and some are just timely good advice like this one

[Maintaining Physical, Social and Mental Fitness for Peak Performance][harvardbusiness]

> **Mental fitness&#xa0;**involves the following seven practices &#x2014; some of which cross over into the physical and social domains: good night's sleep (7-8 hours is recommended), physical activity, focus, reflection, down time, connecting time, and play time. This approach to mental fitness is similar to the [Human Performance Institute][humanperformanceinstitute]'s Corporate Athlete program which focuses on physical, emotional, mental and spiritual (or purpose) sources of energy to build resiliency and drive peak performance.
