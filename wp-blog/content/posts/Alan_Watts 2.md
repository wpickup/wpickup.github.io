![Book by Alan Watts][williampickup]

Reading Alan Watts in my teens I experienced my first taste of eastern thinking which has led to a life long interest. In his essays on Zen and the Tao I could feel deep truths were lurking just beyond the words. A particular favourite is [Cloud-hidden, Whereabouts Unknown: A Mountain Journal][amazon].
  
This collection of essays and transcribed lectures was compiled in 1973 shortly before his death. Watts was an enigmatic character who during this latter period of his life lived on a houseboat moored near San Francisco. He was a hedonist who loved life and indulged in it, causing many to dismiss him as something of a charlatan. For myself and many others however his writings opened the door to eastern thinking. He attempts to convey something to the reader that points to reality and to evoke flashes of insight. I came across an&#xa0;[animated cartoon][souljerky] with an excerpt from a talk of his today via a post at [Post at Goodlife Zen][goodlifezen], definitely worth checking out.

Recordings of Alan Watts are available [here][apple] and are very stimulating and entertaining.
