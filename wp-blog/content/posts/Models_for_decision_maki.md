I like [this](https://creativemarket.com/blog/2013/04/29/models-for-decision-making) introduction to decision making techniques at [Creative Market](https://creativemarket.com).

> "Some decisions appear to be relatively straight forward until you take a step back and look at the entire picture with a fresh perspective. You may notice that there are a variety of factors that actually impact a choice or decision that you did not notice before."

The post also features a nice mind map example from [Learning Fundamentals](http://www.learningfundamentals.com.au) focused on personal actions for reducing climate change impacts.

I find the iPad an ideal tool for mind mapping especially with the power of [iThoughtsHD](http://www.ithoughts.co.uk/iThoughtsHD/Welcome.html).
