I have been enjoying the album [Lost in this beautiful world][apple] by [Jon Lacey][jonlacey]. It's a melodic piano and guitar driven folk album with an authentic feel, partly due to the raw quality of Jon's voice. The songs are introspective and engaging.

I discovered Jon's music while searching for recordings by one his collaborators on this album [Tom McConville][tommcconville]. We saw Tom play at the [Marine Theatre][marinetheatre] in Lyme Regis during our last visit to England in October 2011. It was fun night with a small enthusiastic crowd of locals and the odd traveller. His playing adds haunting depth to some of the albums best songs.
