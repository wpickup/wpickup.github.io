A video of a US policeman calmly capsicum spraying unarmed sitting protestors has created an international storm. [James Fallows][theatlantic] has exhaustive coverage and Mark Bernstein summarises the story with key links and adds his own view in this excellent post&#xa0;[Shame][markbernstein]

> [The walk of shame][youtube], as UC Davis Chancellor Katehi walks to her car before rows of silent students, was extraordinary. James Fallows wrote of the [affectless sadism][theatlantic 2] of the campus police, captured forever in film. If the euro collapse does usher in the second great depression, that video is going to become an icon and [this behind-the-scenes account][cahouse] will someday be treasured the way we cherish stories of riding in the car with Martin.[Bob Ostertag][huffingtonpost] wrote a terrific piece on the shameful militarization of campus police. He doesn&#x2019;t go far enough. Chancellor Katehi claimed that the quad was cleared because of &#x201c;the encampment raised serious health and safety concerns.&#x201d; Ostertag argues treats this as an error, a stupid failure of understanding and planning. But it&#x2019;s not just a mistake.It was a lie.

Perhaps all law enforcement officers should be trained in the fundamentals of non violent action to enable them to more appropriately respond to these situations. [Thoreau's essay][wikipedia]) is a good starting place ([full text here][eserver]), Ghandis' biography is another valuable source.
