Matt Gemmell is such a good writer, his post&#xa0;[Dear TextMate][google] is a beauty and must reflect the thoughts of many former Textmate fans.
  
His recent&#xa0;[Simplicity][mattgemmell] post has me looking into Octopress.  

Another great piece by Matt,&#xa0;[Accessibility for iPhone and iPad apps&#xa0;][mattgemmell 2]is must read for anyone designing a User Interface. I sent this to a friend who suffers the condition Matt was referring to and he was blown away by the insight shown.
