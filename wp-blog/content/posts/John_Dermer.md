In November we travelled down to Kirby's Flat for [John Dermer's][johndermer] annual major exhibition.

Planning to be there early we stayed overnight in Beechworth and arrived at Johns pottery at 10 past nine, assuming we would be the first car in the car park. What a surprise to find about a dozen cars already parked up, even more of a shock was waiting for us when we entered the gallery to find half of&#xa0;the exhibits already proudly bearing their red stickers indicating they were sold.

There were still many beautiful pieces left and we purchased an exquisite salt glazed bowl.
