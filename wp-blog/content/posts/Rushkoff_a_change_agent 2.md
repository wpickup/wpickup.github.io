I have been reading two books by [Douglas Rushkoff][rushkoff]. "Program or Be Programmed" and "Life Inc". These books have well reasoned arguments that encourage a subversive approach to two pervasive elements of modern life

  - The rise of technocratic class that you should join before they take control of to many aspects of your life
  - A fundamental challenge to our modern economic model and the way that plays out in our jobs and life choices

This is fascinating stuff and fits into a rare category of books that change the way you view the world around you.  
There are many videos linked from his website and they are great viewing as he is a gifted orator and spruiker for change.
