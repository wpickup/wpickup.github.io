The latest issue of [Resurgence][resurgence] has arrived and it looks a beauty. At quick skim reveals the usual combination of thoughtful articles and fabulous images.
  
In the spirit of Ghandi's use of spinning as an act of defiance, [Resurgence][resurgence] have chosen baking bread as the theme of their first [Slow Sunday][resurgence 2].  
In each issue of the magazine we will nominate one Sunday when we invite our members to take part in simple actions that symbolise a rejection of commercialism, a passion for the planet and a desire for change.  
  
We will take part here at Slowlane, I will have another go at the [dutch oven technique][motherearthnews] that seems to have worked for many people whose previous bread making efforts produced worthy but not particularly appetising loaves. My two efforts have been ok, plenty of room for improvement though. Its not the fact that this is a no knead recipe that attracts me, rather that it promises to produce a loaf that is crusty yet chewy on the inside.
