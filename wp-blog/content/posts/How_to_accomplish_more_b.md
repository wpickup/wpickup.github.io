Rings true to my own experience
[How to Accomplish More by Doing Less][harvardbusiness]

> It's not just the number of hours we sit at a desk in that determines the value we generate. It's the energy we bring to the hours we work. Human beings are designed to pulse rhythmically between spending and renewing energy. That's how we operate at our best. Maintaining a steady reservoir of energy &#x2014; physically, mentally, emotionally and even spiritually &#x2014; requires refuelling it intermittently

> Stress isn't the enemy in the workplace. Indeed, stress is the only means by which we can expand capacity. Just think about weightlifting. By stressing your muscles, and then recovering, you gradually build strength. Our real enemy is the absence of intermittent renewal.
