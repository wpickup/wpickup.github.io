Horrified to discover the damage that plastic bags were causing to our marine environment, Claire Morsman devised a plan for action - 'sociable guerrilla bagging'.
  
The idea is that people make reusable bags from recycled material and then give them away to friends and family or sometimes during mass handouts.  
Since it began in January 2007, hundreds of people working alone or in "pods" who work together on the bags have made over 20,000 bags. Its taken off in the UK, US, New Zealand, Spain, Japan, Morocco and France.
  
The bags are known as Morsbags.
