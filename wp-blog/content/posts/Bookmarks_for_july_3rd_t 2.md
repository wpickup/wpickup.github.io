These are my links for July 3rd through July 11th:

  - [Peak Water: What Happens When the Wells Go Dry?][permaculturenews] - All over the world irrigators are pumping water from deep acquifiers that will not be replenished through rainfall. When these finally dry up a crisis of water shortage will occur.

  - [None the Wiser by Chris Wood][rousette] - Here is an album review really works for me, by relating a personal account of her experience of seeing the musician and then exploring his new album. Sold.

  - [Storm in an iPhone][rocketink] - An incredible review of a new iPhone app and a fascinating introduction into the world of recording natural soundscapes. Full of interesting links and side tracks. The type of post that makes RSS so valuable.

  - [Peak Timber][blogspot] - Interesting reflection on the investment properties of wood
