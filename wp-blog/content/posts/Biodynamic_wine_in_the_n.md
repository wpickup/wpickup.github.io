Michelle Gadd of [organicwine.com.au][organicwine] has a [good summary][organicwine 2] of recent coverage of biodynamic wine in the Australia media.

With lots of recent media interest in biodynamic wine producers the rest of the world is starting to discover the absolute quality of biodynamic wines.

She is offering some excellent mixed cases of Australian biodynamic wines including the Krinklewood Vordelho mentioned here on Slowlane [recently][slowlane].

Her new [Catalog][organicwine 3] also has a special on a mixed box of [Tamburlaine][tamburlaine] organic wine. I ordered one of these a few months ago and was very pleased with the value for money.

Enjoy.
