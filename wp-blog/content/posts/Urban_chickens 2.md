[Eating Locally: Backyard Chickens][treehugger] at [Treehugger.com][treehugger 2].
Keeping chickens in the urban backyards was commonplace in Australia during the depression and war years and is making a welcome comeback. I wonder how many people are actually able to kill and eat their chickens. I have tried and it takes some getting used to!. Having the chooks for eggs alone is the easier route and very worthwhile as we have posted about [before][slowlane].
