Sophisticated campaign orchestrated by Greenpeace using the same Star Wars theme that feature in the latest VW adds. The aim is to raise pressure on Volkswagen to put more effort into bringing its green technology to bear across its fleet. Worth checking the video's out and sign up..
  
There is good in Volkswagen. We feel it -

> Volkswagen is a big part of many of our lives &#x2013; indeed many rebel vehicles are VWs. But it seems the bosses at Volkswagen have been seduced by the dark side of the Force and left us with little choice but to challenge them. But it&#x2019;s not too late. There&#x2019;s a chance that together we can turn Volkswagen away from the dark side and into a Force for good, leading to a brighter future for us all.
