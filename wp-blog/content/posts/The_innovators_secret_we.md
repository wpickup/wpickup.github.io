Great post over at [MyMicroISV][47hats] from Jarie Bolander. Very timely for me as I in the process to creating a day off a week to allow time to grow a new venture.

[The Innovator&#x2019;s Secret Weapon][google]
 
>   - **Keep an idea journal:** An idea journal is an invaluable tool to find trends and cluster ideas. Just reading through a journal can give you all sorts of inspiration.
>    - **Have a hobby:** Hobbies are great to spark creativity and innovation. I once had a friend who created an entire remote control toy business because he was sick and tired of not having enough frequencies to use.
>   - **Be well read:** Reading a wide variety of topics and styles creates opportunities for cross over innovation. Great ideas will come from looking at a problem from a different perspective. 
>   - **Take long walks:** Wander, stroll, skip or run. Anything to get you out of a building and thinking. Many of my best ideas come when I&#x2019;m working out. 
>   - **Volunteer:** Volunteering is not only tremendously rewarding but a great place for inspiration. You would be amazed at how much you can help an organization and yourself by just giving a few hours a week. 
>   - **Help others innovate:** Get out there and help someone else create. This is just like the recruiting others above and it&#x2019;s for the same reason &#x2013; the more brains, the better the idea flow.
