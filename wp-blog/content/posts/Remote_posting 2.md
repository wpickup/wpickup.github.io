This is my first post from my iPad using Diet Coda to edit the Octopress post.

I have now converted the blog from Wordpress and built a workflow for posting from the iPad.

Not happy worth the load speed of the header so that will probably go, otherwise I really like the simple template that octopress provides.

One of the challenges looks to be efficient syncing of the locally generated site up to my web host, I am using a Transmit synch but it takes about 15 minutes even if only one page has changed.
