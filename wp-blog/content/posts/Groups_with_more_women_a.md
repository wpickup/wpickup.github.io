[Tom Malone on collective intelligence and the &#x201c;genetic&#x201d; structure of groups][google]

> The average intelligence of the people in the group and the maximum intelligence of the people in the group doesn&#x2019;t predict group intelligence.

And this means that &#x2014; wait for it &#x2014; groups with more women tend to be smarter than groups with more men.
