Its Blog Action Day - my plug is for [BEN][benbikes] the Bicycle Empowerment Network of Namibia.  
Established by Australian Michael Linke who had previously edited Australian Cyclist, which at the time was Australia's largest circulation cycling magazine, and [ReNew][ata], a magazine aimed at people designing, making and using solar, wind and biofuel energy devices, lowering their energy consumption and designing environmentally sustainable houses and businesses.  
  
Since starting in May 2005, they have distributed more than 7,000 bicycles, 80 bicycle ambulances and 9 community-based bicycle workshops. BEN has partnered with 51 community-based organisations, mainly focused on home-based care services for people living with HIV/AIDS and orphans and vulnerable children, as well as the dissemination of information on HIV prevention.
