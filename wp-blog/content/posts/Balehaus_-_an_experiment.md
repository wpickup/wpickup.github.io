[The Ecologist][theecologist] is one of the great journals of the green movement and has recently gone through the transformation from print to online. This makes access to its stimulating content much easier.

Click [here][theecologist 2] to read about an interesting prototype building just opened at Bath university that uses pre-fabricated wall panels filled with straw.

The [Bath University Balehaus project site][bath] is worth a look.

When will we have access to locally produced building products like this in Australia I wonder ?
