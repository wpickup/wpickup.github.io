[Steve Zeoli][wordpress] posted a [link][blogs] to the work of [Maira Kalman][mairakalman] in the NY Times today, in this case an enlightening [graphic celebration][blogs] of the inventiveness of Benjamin Franklin. This post was part of a series - "[The Pursuit of Happiness (2009)][mairakalman 2]" - a year long exploration of American History and democracy beginning with a story on the inauguration of Barack Obama.

Here is the NY Times article -\> [Can Do][blogs]

I am looking forward to checking out more of her work, especially the illustrated Michael Pollan book.
