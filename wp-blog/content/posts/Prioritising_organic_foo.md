[Mark Sisson][marksdailyapple] runs a business that promotes a version of the Paleo diet and philosophy ([Primal][marksdailyapple 2]). He writes some excellent posts on his blog that I often find myself nodding in agreement with. A recent post that suggests a prioritised list of what to buy from organic sources is an example.

[What Foods to Buy Organic][marksdailyapple 3]

I like this list. In addition, its also important to consider

  - Animal welfare. Always look for evidence of best practises in animal welfare and support these growers and suppliers
  - Sourcing food outside of the large supermarket monopolies. These organisations are the front line for the globalised industrial agriculture hegemony that places profit above environment, health and people, see ([Supply Chain complexity][eurekastreet], [UK Supermarkets ranked][ethicalconsumer]). Favour local shops, farmers markets and online retailers that support small farms and food diversity.

Its also worth noting that some of the tenets of the Paleo belief system are being challenged by research, as reported at [MacDrifter][macdrifter] today -\> [Paleo Dream][macdrifter 2].
