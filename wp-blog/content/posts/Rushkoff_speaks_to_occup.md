Douglass Rushkoff is always worth reading, here is a rousing speech he gave to Occupy Wallstreet  
[Occupy Reality - Transcript][google]

> You are not fighting against people, but against a machine.It was put in place over 500 years ago.  
> By a wealthy elite - trying to repress a booming peer to peer economy.  
> Those people are all dead, but their program lives on.  
> (Via [Douglas Rushkoff][rushkoff])  

As he says&#xa0;in the opening lines this speech covers the material that is exhaustively documented in his book [Life Inc][amazon] which is a fascinating read.
