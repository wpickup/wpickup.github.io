Tim Bray on&#xa0;[Occupying Wall Street][tbray]:

>   &#x2022; A large number of people in the finance business enriched themselves to the tune of billions in a manner that feels essentially like bald-faced theft. Nobody has been punished. Very few of these people even experienced much in the way of financial setbacks, because they were bailed out with other people&#x2019;s money. As in, yours &amp; mine.  
>     &#x2022; The general degree of inequality, whether measured in money or power, [seems unreasonable][wikipedia].  
>     &#x2022; The political system seems structurally unable to take any action which runs counter to the interests of the finance-industry elite.  
> I think those perceptions are broadly correct, and I think it&#x2019;s reasonable to be angry about them, and to engage in political action: This is what politics is for.
