These are my links for August 1st through August 5th:

  - [Cover Crops Solutions Chart][permaculturenews] - Explains why an "untidy" looking garden is less work and will have healthier soil.

  - [Resurrection Men][monbiot] - Usual great writing from Monbiot as he brings some common sense to the de-extinction conversation while also making a plea for the much more urgent cause of preserving and nurturing the environments of species that are endangered today.

  - [Famous Writers' Small Writing Sheds and Off-the-Grid Huts][apartmenttherapy] - Its time I made some progress on building something like this.

  - [You Call That a Roof?][small-scale] - I enjoy pictures of peoples home made houses. The Shelter books by Lloyd Kahn provide one of my favourite browsing experiences
